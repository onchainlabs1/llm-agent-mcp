# NCR/CAPA â€“ NCR-2025-002

Date: 2025-03-10
Raised by: Compliance Officer

## Nonconformity
Missing document front-matter (owner/version/approved_by/approved_on/next_review) in multiple policy/procedure documents.

## Immediate Correction
Applied standardized front-matter to priority documents (`AI_Management_Policy.md`, `AIMS_Document_Control_Procedure.md`).

## Root Cause Analysis
Lack of documented standard for metadata application across all documents; no automated checks.

## Corrective Action Plan
- Define and apply standard front-matter to all key documents (Documentation Manager)
- Add dashboard compliance scanner (implemented)
- Add recurring review cadence (quarterly)

## Verification of Effectiveness
Verified by management review (MR-2025-002). Dashboard shows document control compliance and exportable non-compliance list.

## Evidence
- Dashboard Document Control Compliance section
- `docs/Clause5_Leadership_new/AI_Management_Policy.md`
- `docs/Clause7_Support/AIMS_Document_Control_Procedure.md`
