  - Risk Management Framework (6.1.1)
  - Risk Identification and Assessment (6.1.2)
  - Risk Treatment (6.1.3)
  - Specific Risk Scenarios (6.1.4)
  - Risk Monitoring and Review (6.1.5)

### 6.2 AI Management System Objectives and Planning

  - Change Categories and Classification (6.3.2)
  - Change Management Process (6.3.3)
  - Risk Assessment and Mitigation (6.3.4)
  - Documentation and Communication (6.3.5)

### Supporting Documents
- **Document:** [`AI_Risk_Register.csv`](./AI_Risk_Register.csv)
- **Purpose:** Spreadsheet recording individual AI risks with likelihood, impact, controls, owner, and status
- **Content:** 3 realistic example risks tailored to LLM agent system

- **Document:** [`Statement_of_Applicability.csv`](./Statement_of_Applicability.csv)
- **Purpose:** Table listing all Annex A controls (A.2 to A.10) with implementation status
- **Content:** All 38 controls with columns for implementation status, justification, and linked documents
