2025-08-18T19:32:06.727639,Explain quantum computing in simple terms,"Quantum computing is like having a computer that can be in multiple states at once, unlike regular computers that are either 0 or 1. It uses quantum mechanics principles to process information much faster for certain types of problems.",gpt-4,0.5,8,38,980,0.82,0.89,MEDIUM,0.02,trace_1755538626_002
2025-08-18T19:27:06.727645,What is machine learning and how does it work?,Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It works by training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions.,gpt-4,0.3,10,42,1100,0.91,0.94,LOW,0.01,trace_1755538626_003
